* Package Manager

Emacs has package manager named *elpa* since version 24.

We setup elpa repo to make it more easy to use.

[[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]] is a great 3rd party elpa repo which contains many good emacs
lisp plugin that you can't find under elpa.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
    '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

Initial elpa

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (package-initialize)
#+END_SRC
